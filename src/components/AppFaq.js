    question: 'Which industries do you develop mobile applications for?',
    answer: 'We devise applications for almost every industry. This includes e-commerce, education, entertainment, and finance. Also, we develop apps for restaurants, healthcare, socials, sports, travel, fitness, and wellness.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do your cross-platform apps operate as native apps?',
    answer: 'Our cross-platform apps offer performance just like the native mobile apps. Especially with the latest frameworks like React Native and Flutter. Native apps are great for performance and user experience. However, cross-platform development is a great alternative. It allows quick development, low costs, and easy maintenance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can your mobile apps work on all devices and different screen sizes?',
    answer: 'Yes, we use various techniques to test our mobile apps. We test them on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness. You can use the mobile app on any device as we ensure it adapts perfectly to different resolutions. Your mobile app will always deliver a smooth experience.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which security considerations do you take for mobile app development?',
    answer: 'We always focus on the appâ€™s security. For this, we use encryption to protect sensitive data and use secure authentications. We also follow industry measures like OWASP/ASVS to ensure adherence to GDPR and HIPAA.'
